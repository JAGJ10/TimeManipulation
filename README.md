TimeManipulation
=========

A prototype written in Java using libgdx (http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) implementing the rewind ability from Braid. 

Additional functionality was added in the spirit of Bret Victor's "Inventing on Principle" presentation (https://vimeo.com/36579366) which allows you to alter your speed and then see a trajectory of what your previous inputs would do with the changed velocity.
